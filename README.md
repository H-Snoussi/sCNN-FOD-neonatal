## Summary

We introduce a geometric deep learning framework based on **rotationally equivariant Spherical CNNs (sCNNs)** to estimate **Fiber Orientation Distributions (FODs)** from neonatal diffusion MRI (dMRI) with **only 30% of the full acquisition protocol**. The model was trained and evaluated on 43 neonatal dMRI datasets from the Developing Human Connectome Project (dHCP).

### Highlights
- **SO(3)-equivariant** spherical convolutions that respect rotational symmetries of diffusion signals.
- **Shell-attention mechanism** to dynamically weight contributions from different b-value shells.
- **Spatial-domain loss function** for perceptually meaningful FOD reconstructions.
- Achieves **superior FOD estimation** and tractography compared to standard MLP and MSMT-CSD.
