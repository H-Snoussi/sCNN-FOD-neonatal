### Summary

We introduce a geometric deep learning framework based on **rotationally equivariant Spherical CNNs (sCNNs)** to estimate **Fiber Orientation Distributions (FODs)** from neonatal diffusion MRI (dMRI), using **only 30% of the full diffusion acquisition protocol**. This approach enables faster and more practical neonatal imaging. The model was trained and evaluated on 43 neonatal dMRI datasets from the Developing Human Connectome Project (dHCP).

### Highlights
- Uses **only 30%** of the dHCP acquisition protocol â€” reducing scan time and motion artifacts.
- Employs **SO(3)-equivariant spherical convolutions** to preserve rotational symmetries of diffusion signals.
- Incorporates a **shell-attention mechanism** for adaptive fusion across b-value shells.
- Optimized with a **spatial-domain loss function** to prioritize perceptually meaningful FOD reconstructions.
- Delivers **superior tractography** compared to both standard MLP and MSMT-CSD methods.
