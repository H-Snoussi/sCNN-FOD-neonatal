sCNN for FOD estimation from neonatal dMRI


Rotationally Equivariant Spherical CNNs for Fiber Orientation Estimation in Neonatal Diffusion MRI
This repository contains code and models for estimating white matter fiber orientation distributions (FODs) from neonatal diffusion MRI using spherical convolutional neural networks (sCNNs). The framework leverages rotational equivariance for robust FOD reconstruction from reduced dMRI acquisitions, enabling accurate tractography in the developing brain.
